This plugin extends the category and archive lists by providing a dropdown
(select) box with a button or link to activate the selection.

== Description ==

Daniel's DropDowns extends the standard WordPress category and archive template
tags.  It provides a category dropdown that uses the standard WordPress link
tags for its targets, so it will work with the standard permalinks, or any
form of "pretty" permalinks.  The archive dropdown is a lot simpler, as that
template tag will create option entries with the proper links.

Both dropdowns also include buttons or links to activate the current selection,
and they can be rendered with the default CSS classes of "ddd\_select" and
"ddd\_button", or classes (including a blank parameter for no specified CSS
class) can be specified in the template tags.

== Installation ==

Upload "daniels\_dropdowns.php" to your wp-content/plugins directory.  It can
then be activate through the WordPress Plugin Administration page, and the
desired template tag(s) added to your theme as desired.  The tags and their
parameters are detailed in the documentation at the top of the plugin.
